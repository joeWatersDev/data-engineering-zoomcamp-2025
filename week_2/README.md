# WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION

This is the process of tying together the many steps of a data pipeline (Extracting, transforming, loading, etc.), the tools that perform them and automating their execution.

### KESTRA

Kestra is a workflow orchestration tool similar to Apache Airflow.

As opposed to *automation* which is the execution of individual task without manual intervention, *orchestration* automates the flow of multiple interconnected tasks and processes, ensuring each is executed in the correct order with the right dependenncies etc. A common use case is an ETL data pipeline.
